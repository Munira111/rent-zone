# Project Year
2022/2023 third semester 
# Introduction
"Rent Zone" is designed to be a comprehensive platform that seamlessly connects home seekers with homeowners, creating a singular destination for both parties to meet their rental needs.
# Overview 
"Rent Zone" is crafted using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for client-side interactivity, and PHP for server-side scripting. It leverages an SQL database to manage and store data
# Prerequisites
XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP or any other local server solution with PHP and MySQL.
phpMyAdmin (usually included with XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP).
A code editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
# Steps
Install Local Server Environment
Download and install XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or a similar stack that includes PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin.
Start the Apache and MySQL services.
Prepare the Source Code
Place the "Rent Zone" source code directory into the htdocs directory (XAMPP), www directory (WAMP), or the corresponding location for your local server setup.
Create the Database
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Create a new database named rentzone.
Import the Database Structure
Within phpMyAdmin, select the rentzone database you just created.
Click on the "Import" tab.
Choose the rentzone.sql file provided with your "Rent Zone" source code.
Click "Go" to import the structure and any initial data into your database.
Configure the Application
Find the config.php file or its equivalent in the "Rent Zone" source code.
Edit the database connection settings to match your local environment (typically, the username is "root" and the password is left blank).
Ensure that the database name matches the name you created in phpMyAdmin (rentzone).
Run the Project
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/rentzone (assuming 'rentzone' is the directory name of your project).
You should now see the "Rent Zone" homepage and be able to interact with the application.
